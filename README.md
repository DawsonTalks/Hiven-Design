# Hiven Design

Project is in early stages. More features and details will be added in the near future.

## Contributing

It's easy to add your design to the site for everyone to use.

1. Go to [designs.json](designs.json)
2. Find the edit pencil icon right above the first line of JSON text. Clicking this will automatically fork the repo to your personal account.
3. Add your design theme to the JSON object. Follow the format used in previous entries. The long crazy string is the theme code generated by Hiven. Note, if it's the last entry, don't put an ending comma.

Thank you for contributing! I will be checking PRs daily.
